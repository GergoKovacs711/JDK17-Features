# Repository for the JDK 17 features Dojo

The repository was created as a mean to summarise the most useful upcoming language features for the next LTS JDK - 17.

The dojo section covers the major language features released with the JDKs 12-17, with the inclusion of the preview feature - `pattern matching in switch`.

Most feature groups have corresponding challenges which are aimed to deepen the understanding of the covered features and give a chance to try them out in action.

_`The challenges are to be released in a separate branch, on the day of the dojo - 2022.03.24`_

## Covered features
 * Stream collector - teeing
 * Predicate not
 * String features - text blocks, indent, transform
 * Sealed types - class and interface
 * Records
 * Files methods - writeString, readString, mismatch
 * Pattern matching
 * Updated switch, _pattern matching for switch_ (still in preview, as of JDK 18)


The `FeatureGroups` contains the code used in the campus presentation - Overview of JDK 17 features - which was held in 2021.


## Requirements
1. JDK 17 (or newer) 
2. IntelliJ or Eclipse
3. The enabling of language preview features (for pattern matching for switch)
